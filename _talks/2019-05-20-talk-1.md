Abstract
Off-the-shelf machine learning based intrusion detection systems (IDS) have proved not suitable for protecting industrial control systems (ICS), as they do not consider cooperative regularities between controllers of control loops, and the serious shortage of attacking training sets. We study the consensus and complementary (2C) features which are widely observed in control loops. Subsequently, a multi-view learning framework is proposed to boost the effectiveness of detecting attacks on ICS by using a large number of unlabeled examples with 2C features. Comprehensive attacks of ICS are designed and implemented on a physical testbed, and the experimental data are collected from the historical sequences and IDS alerts. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework is highly adaptive, and it can rapidly match the dynamics of ICS operating environment. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the method is discussed when parameters take different values, and it exhibits low false-positive rates but high precision. In addition, the case of error propagation of the framework is analyzed.
